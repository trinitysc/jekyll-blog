Our Values
--

Trinity South Christchurch is a church created by, built upon, sustained through, 
and delighting in the gospel of the Lord Jesus.  

Our core values are an expression of who we are:

Hearing Jesus Speak:  We long to and expect to hear Jesus speak as we hear his word in the Bible.

Seeing Jesus Work: We delight to see Jesus’ work for us in the cross and resurrection, and to see him continue to work by his Spirit in our lives today.

Sharing Jesus’ Love: We share his love both by sharing his message and by showing his care to those around us.

Everyone is welcome at Trinity.  No matter your background or belief, we believe in a God who turns no-one away who seeks him, and who transforms all of us, by the work of his Spirit, into the image and likeness of Jesus.
