    <p>At Trinity, our hope is that every member has both the desire and opportunity to serve. We believe that Jesus has given every Christian gifts to serve--to <i>minister to</i>--their fellow Christians and to the community around them. And we see each other taking joy in welcoming newcomers; making and bringing food; serving tea and coffee; visiting each other; making meals for the sick; filling in forms; photocopying things.</p>
    <p>Some are called to more specific, and visible, roles. Here are some the people you're likely to meet if you come on a Sunday.</p>
