<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p class="brochure">We exist to see <strong>lives transformed</strong> into the likeness of <strong>Christ</strong>, through the <strong>preaching
of the Word</strong> and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">Our Values</h2>

<p>Trinity South Christchurch is a church created by, built upon, sustained through, 
and delighting in the gospel of the Lord Jesus. Our core values are an expression of who we are.</p>

<p class="brochure">We long to and expect to <strong>hear Jesus speak</strong> as we hear his word in the <strong>Bible</strong>.</p>

<p class="brochure">We delight to <strong>see Jesusâ€™ work</strong> for us in the <strong>cross and resurrection</strong>, and to see him continue to 
    work by his Spirit in our lives today.</p>

<p class="brochure">We <strong>share Jesus' love</strong> both by <strong>sharing his message</strong> and by <strong>showing his care</strong> to those around us.</p>

<p>
  Everyone is welcome at Trinity.  No matter your background or belief, we believe in a God who turns no-one
  away who seeks him, and who transforms all of us, by the work of his Spirit, into the image and likeness of Jesus.<p>

<h2 class="mt-4">Our People</h2>
<p>We are a family of around 200 people. We come from a variety of backgrounds, are always welcoming, and occasionally well-dressed. We have a bunch of students (Engineering is a bit over-represented, but we also have at least one classics student) and one lecturer (of Tax History, but he promises not try to tell you about it unless you ask). We have a number of nurses and a surgeon; a number of builders and a few gardeners, though only these latter have ever practised on-site. A couple of members of the congregation do stunning desserts, which occasionally appear after church. There's a spread of kids through most ages, and a bunch of people from the nearby Archer Village. </p>
