        We are an <strong>evangelical</strong> church created by, built upon, sustained through,
        and delighting in the <strong>gospel of the Lord Jesus</strong>.
        As part of the <a href="https://confessinganglicans.nz/">Church of Confessing Anglicans</a> (CCAANZ),
        we gladly stand in the <strong>Anglican</strong> tradition.

    <h2 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Because we love Jesus, we love what Jesus loves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus loved his Father, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205%3A19-30&version=NIV">joyfully submitted to his will</a>. We delight to offer ourselves in sacrificial service to our father in heaven.</li>
      <li>Jesus gave his life <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019%3A10&version=NIV">to save the lost</a>. We joyfully sacrifice to introduce others to Jesus.</li>
      <li>Jesus <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A33-35&version=NIV">loved his followers and wept for them</a>. We are committed to one another like Jesus is committed to us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are <a href="/articles/devotion/">grounded in the Bible</a>, since it is in his word that we meet him and learn about what he loves.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Our People</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone is welcome at Trinity.  No matter your background or belief, we believe in a God who turns no-one
      away who seeks him, and who transforms all of us, by the work of his Spirit, into the image and likeness of Jesus.
    <p>
    <p>We are a family of around 200 people. We come from a variety of backgrounds, are always welcoming, and occasionally well-dressed. We have a bunch of students (Engineering is a bit over-represented, but we also have at least one classics student) and one lecturer (of Tax History, but he promises not to tell you about it unless you ask). We have a number of nurses and a surgeon; a number of builders and a few gardeners, though only these latter have ever practised on-site. A couple of members of the congregation do stunning desserts, which occasionally appear after church. There's a spread of kids through most ages, and a bunch of people from the nearby Archer Village. </p>
    <p>Our aim as a church is to grow as disciples of Jesus â€” and to help others grow as disciples too. We believe spiritual maturity looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="/articles/devotion/">Loving God</a> and living for His glory</li>
      <li>Belonging to Jesus in community with His people</li>
      <li>Serving one another as Jesus has served us</li>
      <li>Growing into the likeness of Jesus</li>
      <li>Sharing Jesus as we join in His mission to the world</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Our Wider Partnership</h2>
