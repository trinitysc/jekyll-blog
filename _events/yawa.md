Welcome back to another **Young Adults Weekend Away**!

Once again on Matariki weekend (Thursday 19th to Saturday 21st June) we are heading to the STAC Lodge at Castle Hill for a weekend 
of fun and fellowship. This year, our theme is spies, so prepare yourself for some spy themed activities as we hear from Rob Morton 
(Director of the Tim Training Course) as he opens up the Bible to talk to us about fellowship.
