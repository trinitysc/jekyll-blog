Our daytime Church wide prayer meeting will be held November 5th from 10:00-11:30 am. 
Come from 9:30 am for coffee.
There is no need to pray out loud if you don’t feel comfortable doing so, but your presence and “Amen” will be of great encouragement to others. Please note that there will be no normal Fellowship groups this week.
