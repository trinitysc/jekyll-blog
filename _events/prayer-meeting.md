Our evening Church wide prayer meeting will be held on Tuesday the 11th of March from 7:30-9pm. 
There is no need to pray out loud if you don’t feel comfortable doing so, but your presence and “Amen” will be of great encouragement to others. Please note that there will be no normal Fellowship groups this week.
