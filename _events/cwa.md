Our 2025 Church Weekend Away is taking place at Woodend Camp from the 14th-16th of March. 
<!--excerpt end-->

Tim Capill, the assistant minister at Latimer Church will be speaking. 

If you're not a happy camper, don't be put off. Despite the name, [Woodend Christian Camp](https://www.woodendcamp.co.nz/) has indoor twin and family rooms. There is a range of facilities to help [keep the kids busy](https://www.woodendcamp.co.nz/activities), and the site is a reasonable walk from the beach.

More details to follow.
