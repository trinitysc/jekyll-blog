Our 2026 Church Weekend Away is taking place in Woodend from the 13th-15th of March. 
<!--excerpt end-->

Chris Spark, the minister at St Peter's of the Rock will be speaking. 

If you're not a happy camper, don't be put off. Despite the name, [Woodend Christian Camp](https://www.woodendcamp.co.nz/) has indoor twin and family rooms. There is a range of facilities to help [keep the kids busy](https://www.woodendcamp.co.nz/activities), and the site is a reasonable walk from the beach.

Prices are as follows:
 - Adult - $160 (2025: $155)
 - In school - $80 (2025: $75)
 - 0-4 yrs - $45 (2025: $40)
 - Day Visitor - $45 ($20 per child) (2025: $40)
 - Household Limit - $420 (2025: $400)

Please be in touch if finances will prevent you from coming, as we are keen to help as many as possible be able to come. 
If you have any other questions, please contact Jasmine Butcher (or one of the staff at info@trinitysc.nz)
