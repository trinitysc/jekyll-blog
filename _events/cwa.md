Our 2025 Church Weekend Away is taking place at Woodend Camp from the 14th-16th of March. 
<!--excerpt end-->

Tim Capill, the assistant minister at Latimer Church will be speaking. 

If you're not a happy camper, don't be put off. Despite the name, [Woodend Christian Camp](https://www.woodendcamp.co.nz/) has indoor twin and family rooms. There is a range of facilities to help [keep the kids busy](https://www.woodendcamp.co.nz/activities), and the site is a reasonable walk from the beach.

Prices are as follows:
 - Adult - $155 (2024: $150)
 - In school - $75 (2024: $75)
 - 0-4 yrs - $40 (2024: $40)
 - Day Visitor - $40 ($20 per child) (same as 2024)
 - Household Limit - $400 (2024: $390)

As always, don't let cost stop you from coming. If finances are a concern, we can work something out.
