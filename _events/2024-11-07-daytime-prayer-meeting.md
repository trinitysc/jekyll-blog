This term we will begin a daytime prayer meeting from 10-11:30am on Wednesday the 20th of November, come for coffee from 9:30. There is no need to pray out loud if you don’t feel comfortable doing so, but your presence and “Amen” will be of great encouragement to others. Please note that there will be no normal Fellowship groups this week. You are welcome at either (or both) of the prayer meetings this term.
