At Trinity we have an annual Women's Weekend Away, where we stay in holiday homes in Hanmer and grow in fellowship as we hear from God's word. Bookings are open for this year's weekend, which runs from Thursday 15th - Saturday 17th May. We will be looking at the book of Hebrews together. 
<!--excerpt end-->

We understand for some who work on Fridays that this means you can't join us, but we are planning to rethink how we arrange the days for 2026 to make it more accessible. 

For several years, we've kept the Weekend Away at $90. However, with rising costs such as accommodation, the price this year will be $110. Please be in touch if this will be a barrier, because we really want you there!

If you aren't sure if you can make it or not, please [get in touch](/contact). Because we are blessed to have more women with us at Trinity this year, we want to make sure we can plan to have the right venue and enough accomodation for everyone.
