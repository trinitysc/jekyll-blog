Our next "All Aboard" course starts on Monday 21st July (7.30-9.15). 

<!--excerpt end-->

All Aboard is mini-fellowship group where you can spend a little time getting to know James and some of the staff plus others who are recent arrivals at Trinity. Over dessert, we will be digging into the Bible with a particular focus on thinking about who we are as Trinity Church and the practicalities of our life together. I know the name sounds like we are pirates, but the idea is serious, we want all those who join Trinity to feel a part of our family and we don't want anyone left behind. I'd love you to join if you were able.
