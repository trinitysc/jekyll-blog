GOAT Meals are for us to Gather Over A Table, and we would love you to save the date for the weekend of 22-24 August, when we are planning to group everyone to share meals in different homes on the Saturday or Sunday, so that we might share food and get to know each other better.

Registrations are now closed, but there are still a few spaces available on selected days and times. If you'd like to find out what these are please email Mackenzie (mackenzie@trinitysc.nz)
