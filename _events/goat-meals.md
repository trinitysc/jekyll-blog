GOAT Meals are for us to Gather Over A Table, and we would love you to save the date for the weekend of 22-24 August, when we are planning to group everyone to share meals in different homes on the Saturday or Sunday, so that we might share food and get to know each other better.

Registrations are now closed, but if you'd like to sign up please email Mackenzie at mackenzie@trinitysc.nz so she can allocate you to a meal.
