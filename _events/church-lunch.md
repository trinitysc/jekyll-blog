From 12:30pm on the 24th of November we will be sharing lunch togther as a church.
<!--excerpt end-->

Surnames A-F and G-O please bring something savoury to share 
Surnames P-Z please bring something sweet to share

Please bring enough to share, and food that requires minimal kitchen is ideal as oven space is limited. 
In the past we've had excellent suggestions of a plate of sandwiches, savoury muffins, pasta salad, couscous with veggies/nuts/seeds, chopped up carrots/capsicum/celery and hummus, or crackers and cheese.
