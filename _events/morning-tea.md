On 30 November we will share a special morning tea after the 9am service.
<!--excerpt end-->

Details to follow.
<!-- Surnames A-F and G-O please bring something savoury to share 
Surnames P-Z please bring something sweet to share

Please bring enough to share, and food that requires minimal kitchen is ideal as oven space is limited. 
In the past we've had excellent suggestions of a plate of sandwiches, savoury muffins, pasta salad, couscous with veggies/nuts/seeds, chopped up carrots/capsicum/celery and hummus, or crackers and cheese.
