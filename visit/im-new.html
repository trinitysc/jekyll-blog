    <h2>Investigating Christianity</h2>
    <p>Trinity runs a course called <a href="/visit/introducing-god">Introducing God</a> – a chance for you to explore who God is and how you can know him. It’s a relaxed and friendly environment where no question is off limits, you can wrestle with big questions or sit back and listen to ideas from other people. The course runs periodically, if you’d like more information or to register for the next one please be in touch.</p>
