      We will be exploring the claim that Jesus is God’s King as we work through Mark’s Gospel.
      Afterwards we will share a meal together, where you are welcome to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>Come and check out our warm and relaxed community!</p>
    <p>You'll find us at 200 Colombo Street.</p>
