    <h2>Our 9am Service</h2>
    <p>Our 9am service is the more traditional and intimate of our services. We use a little more liturgy than in our other services, and are led from the piano. We share the Lordâ€™s Supper on the first and third Sunday of the month. Our 9am congregation skews a little older, but is represented across all ages.</p>
    <p>People usually stay after the service for a cup of tea or coffee.</p>
    <p>You'll find us at 200 Colombo Street. <b style="color:darkred;"><i>Except for this Sunday (March 16), when we'll be away at Camp. The 6pm service will run as normal</i></b> and morning services will be back from March 23.</p>
