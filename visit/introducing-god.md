### Come and meet the God who loves you.

![logo](/media/introducing-god.png)

Come and explore who God is and how you can know him. In a relaxed and friendly
environment where no question is off-limits, you can wrestle with big questions or sit
back and listen to other people’s ideas. Never thought about God? Re-exploring your
Christian roots? Somewhere in between? You are very welcome.

We'll enjoy dinner together and have some time getting to know each other before
watching a short video and discussing the ideas it raises.

We meet on Wednesday nights at Trinity Church, 200 Colombo Street beginning
February 12. Introducing God runs for 7 weeks but there’s no need to commit to the
whole thing now, just come along for the first week and see how it goes!

Introducing God is free of charge. [Contact Pam](mailto:pam@trinitysc.nz) to find out about the next course
and reserve your place.
