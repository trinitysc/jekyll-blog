Come and meet the God who loves you.

To have a relationship with someone, you need to get to know them first.

Trinity Church runs a course called Introducing God – it’s a chance for you to explore who God is and how you can know him. It’s a relaxed and friendly environment where no question is off limits, you can wrestle with big questions or sit back and listen to ideas from other people. The course runs periodically, if you’d like more information please get in touch.

We meet on Tuesday nights in the church lounge. We share a delicious dinner and have some time to get to know each other before watching a short video and discussing the ideas it raises.

The evenings is run by James our Minister who facilitates the discussion and ensures everyone has an opportunity to contribute!

Introducing God runs for 8 weeks but there’s no need to commit to the whole thing, just come along for the first week and see how it goes!

For more information or to find out about when the next course is email info@trinitysc.nz or give the church office a call 03 669 2954.
