    <p>We are trialling having a live transcript of our church services in various languages.
      This is both for those who are hard of hearing and wish to follow in English, and for
    those for whom English is not their first language.</p>
    <p>We currently have subtitles in Chinese, Hindi, and Tamil.</p>
    <p>Simply scan the QR Code on your phone or click <a href="https://beta.sunflowerai.io/audience/BPF0YU">here</a>.</p>
