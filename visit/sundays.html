    <h2>We’d love to welcome you this Sunday at 9am and 10.45am!</h2>
    <p>Whether you’ve been invited along by a friend, exploring Christianity or just curious about our church – there’s a place for you at Trinity.</p>
    <p>Part of the reason we gather each week is to welcome and include visitors who are new to church, and new to Christianity. We try to be as clear and accommodating as possible.</p>
    <p>You'll find us at 200 Colombo Street.</p>

    <h2>We meet at 9am, 10.45am, and 6pm</h2>
    <p>Each service runs for around 65-80 minutes. Led from the front, we will sing, pray, hear a passage of the Bible read followed by a 25-35 minute talk explaining its relevance for our lives today. At the moment we are looking at the book of Mark.</p>
    <p>You are welcome to participate in as much or as little of this as you feel comfortable. If you doze off we won't judge you.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Some FAQs</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>What type of church is Trinity?</summary>
      <p>We're an Anglican evangelical Church made up of Christians of all ages. Read about our beliefs <a href="/about/who-we-are">here</a>.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What should I wear?</summary>
      <p>Wear whatever you'd feel comfortable wearing to a cafe. Ray has been known to sport a tweed jacket, while Calvin prefers Hawaiian shirts. Most people are somewhere in between.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do I need to bring anything?</summary>
      <p>Just yourself. But feel free to bring a friend.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Do I have to give money?</summary>
      <p>No, you won't be asked to give money. We love the generosity of our members, but we deliberately chose not to take a collection in the service. The reason Christianity is such good news is that forgiveness is free, because God has paid for it. We are therefore really pleased to have people come and hear that good news, free of charge. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>What if I’m not a Christian, Anglican, baptised or even a church-goer?</summary>
      <p>Then you're particularly welcome. Trinity is made up of people from all sorts of backgrounds and walks of life. We do our best to explain what’s happening during our church services. You have a standing invitation to explore Jesus and why we think he’s so great.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Where can I park?</summary>
      <p>If you have limited mobility, please feel free to park on-site. There is some limited parking to the right of the church building. Otherwise there is parking on the nearby Roxburgh, Boon, and Southey Streets. Most people find parking spaces within 100 metres or so.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Can I bring a pram?</summary>
      <p>Yes. There is plenty of room for prams. We also have a dedicated creche room for babies and their carers, complete with toys and changing facilities. The creche is just off the auditorium and there is an audio-visual link so you can still join in the service while caring for your child. </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is Trinity assisted-hearing friendly?</summary>
      <p>We have a system in the church building that will connect to most hearing aids. The folk at the sound desk will be happy to help you connect.</p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Is Trinity wheelchair friendly?</summary>
      <p>There is a wheelchair-accessible entrance to the left of the main entrance.</p>
