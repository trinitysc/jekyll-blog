    <h2>We’d love to welcome you this Sunday at 9am and 10.45am!</h2>
    <p>Whether you’ve been invited along by a friend, exploring Christianity or just curious about our church – there’s a place for you at Trinity.</p>
    <p>Part of the reason we gather each week is to welcome and include visitors who are new to church, and new to Christianity. We try to be as clear and inclusive as possible.</p>

    <h2>We meet at 9am and 10.45am</h2>
    <p>Each service runs for around 65-80 minutes. Led from the front, we will sing, pray, hear a Bible reading and a 25-35 minute Bible talk (usually called a sermon) explaining its relevance for our lives today. You are welcome to participate in as much or as little of this as you feel comfortable.</p>

          The 9am is more intimate, and slightly more traditional in style. We share the Lord’s Supper on the first and third Sunday of the month.

          The 10.45 is more relaxed, with music led by a band. Our children’s programme for those from Age 3 to School Year 9 begins just before the sermon and visiting children are very welcome to join.

    <p>We enjoy a cuppa and some baking after both services. Some people come early to the 10.45 (from about 10.15) to meet those from the earlier service.</p>

    <h2>Some FAQs</h2>
    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
    <p>You can wear whatever clothes you’re comfortable in. Ray likes to wear a sports jacket, while Calvin prefers Hawaian shirts. So there's a range of views on dress here.</p>
    <h3>Do I need to bring anything?</h3>
    <p>Just yourself. But feel free to bring a friend.</p>
    <h3>Do I have to give money?</h3>
    <p>No. We love the generosity of our members but we deliberately chose not to take a collection in the service. The reason Christianity is such good news is that forgiveness is free because God has paid for it. We are therefore really pleased to have people come to church free of charge. </p>
    <h3>What if I’m not a Christian, Anglican, baptised or even a church-goer?</h3>
    <p>Trinity is made up of people from all sorts of backgrounds and walks of life. We do our best to explain what’s happening during our church services – no knowledge assumed. You have a standing invitation to explore Jesus and why we think he’s so great.</p>
    <h3>Where can I park?</h3>
    <p>If you have limited mobility, please feel free to park on-site. There is some limited parking to the right of the church building. Otherwise there is parking on Roxburgh, Boon, and Southey Streets.</p>
    <h3>Can I bring a pram?</h3>
    <p>Yes. There is plenty of room for prams. We also have a dedicated creche room for babies and their carers complete with toys and changing facilities. The creche is just off the auditorium and there is an audio-visual link so you can still join in the service while caring for your child.</p>
    <h3>Is Trinity assisted-hearing friendly?</h3>
    <p>We have a system in the church building that will connect to most hearing aids. The folk at the sound desk will be happy to help you connect.</p>
    <h3>Is Trinity wheelchair friendly?</h3>
    <p>There is a wheelchair accessible entrance to the left of the main entrance.</p>
