What does it mean to have a relationship with God? How do we grow as Christians? Why are Quiet Times so hard to persist with? Why does reading the Bible so often feel dry? What is, or should be, the point of studying the Bible? In a sense, the answer to all these questions lies in the concept of Devotion.
<!--excerpt end-->

"Devotion" has many interpretations, but in a general sense we think of it as the showing of love and loyalty to someone. Devotion to God therefore displays our  love and loyalty to him. To think correctly about what that looks like, we need to start with understanding what exactly is our relationship to him. At heart, this means beginning all it does for all matters Christian) with the Gospel.

## The Gospel

We can summarise the message of the New Testament as [_adoption through propitiation_](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/how-would-you-summarize-the-new-testament-in-three-words/). Simply put, **because the Son of God willingly became man and gave his life for us on the Cross, those who believe in him are no longer enemies of God, but are God's children.** 
> This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an <mark>atoning sacrifice</mark> for our sins ... See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called <mark>children of God</mark>! And that is what we are! (1 John 4:10, 1 John 3:1)

### Christ is our Saviour

Many Christians will have heard of how Martin Luther, on reading [Romans 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%201%3A16-17&version=NIV), [came to the realisation](https://lutheranreformation.org/theology/luthers-breakthrough-romans/) that:
> As a monk I led an irreproachable life. Nevertheless I felt that I was a sinner before God. My conscience was restless, and I could not depend on God being propitiated by my satisfactions. Not only did I not love, but **I actually hated the righteous God who punishes sinners…**  Thus a furious battle raged within my perplexed conscience, but meanwhile I was knocking at the door of this particular Pauline passage, earnestly seeking to know the mind of the great apostle. **Day and night I tried to meditate upon the significance of these words: ‘The righteousness of God is revealed in it, as it is written: The righteous shall live by faith'**.

Luther's realisation that we are saved, not by works, but by faith, led to the Protestand Reformation, and the church we now attend. As Christians, we know we have been saved by Grace alone, through faith in the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.

The gospel is thus central to our faith. And the death of Jesus is thus central the Gospel. And not just the death of Jesus, but the person of Jesus. 
>  Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you ...that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scripture (1 Corinthians 15:1-4)  
>  So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. (2 Corinthians 2:6)

Indeed, in a sense Jesus _is_ the gospel:
>  For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord. (2 Corinthians 4:5)

While it's hard to argue that we can ever over-emphasise the cross, sometimes we forget just how momentous the incarnation itself was. That Jesus of Nazareth was God made man is a claim that should never cease to amaze us:
> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. ... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:1-14)

Somehow the Son of God became a human, voluntarily limiting himself, in order to do the will of his Father:
> Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does.  ... For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. ... By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me." (John 5:19-30)

In his submission, Jesus suffered as he was tempted, resisting to become the perfect man.
> Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. (Hebrews 2:18). For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. (Hebrews 4:15-16)

And now it is this Jesus who sits at the right hand of God, interceding on our behalf:
> Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. ... you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. (Col 3:1-3)
>  Now there have been many ... priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. (Hebrews 7:23-25)
 
### We are God's Children

What Luther also realised, but is often lost in our thinking, is what we are saved _for_. We understand well that we are saved from the sinful state that all humans share. We tend to know that in some way we are saved in order to go to heaven, though our vision of what that means can be fuzzy.  What we tend to overlook is that we are saved for **adoption**.

What the gospel tells us is that, thanks to Jesus, not only have we been saved from sin, but that God sees us as family. To be a Christian is to have God as our Father:
> Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God. (John 1:12-13)
> Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba,Father." So **you are no longer a slave, but God’s child**; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir.  (Galatians 4:6-7)

Not only that, but we have Jesus--the Son of God who died for us, and who intercedes for us--as our brother:
> "Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother." (Mark 3:35)
> "Go ... to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” (John 20:17)

It is easy to overlook this privilege, and what it means. To the Israelites, God's covenant name was "I AM", reflecting his eternal greatness. God's relationship with Israel was affectionate: "I will be your God, and you will be my people," but distant: only the High Priest could go into the presence of God, and only on the Day of Ateonment, after purifying himself for the sins of himself and of the people.

By contrast, we are able to talk to God as our Father, and approach him:
> Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God ... For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. ...Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings. (Hebrews 10:11-22)
> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens (Hebrews 7:22-26)

### We have an Eternal Hope

As God's children, we are also heirs, of an eternal hope.
> When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory. (Col 3:4)
> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 6:23)

And what is the eternal hope? It is to be with Jesus and to share in his glory:
> After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. ... Encourage one another with these words. (1 Thessalonians 4:17-18)
> Now if we are children, then we are heirs—-heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. (Romans 8:17)
> Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb ... No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. ... They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever. (Rev 22:1-5)

## Enjoying the Father

While we might _be_ God's children, destined for eternal glory, in the mundane reality of daily life we often don't _feel_ like God's children. How then do we enjoy the intimacy implied by this familial description? 

For many, the answer lies in seeking some kind of "experience of the Holy Spirit." But this isn't how the role of the Spirit is presented in the New Testament. The Spirit is a Spirit of Adoption:
> For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. (Romans 8:14-16)

Instead, the Holy Spirit's role is to direct us to Jesus, and to his words:
>  "But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.” (John 16:13-15)

And that is how we listen to God. By listening to his words. 

### Hearing God

The Bible is clear on how we should seek God. Throughout the Old Testament, God's people are continually called back to his Word.

Abraham is commended for his faith, display when he listened to God and believed his promises:
> Then the word of the Lord came to him: ... “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness. (Gen 15:5-6)

Moses told the Israelites:
> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates. ... And if we are careful to obey all this law before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness. (Deut 6:4-25)

King David said:
> Blessed is the one ... whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. (Psalm 1:1-2)

Why do we read the Bible? To know and love God.
> This is what the Lord says: “Let not the wise boast of their wisdom, or the strong boast of their strength
    ... but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me." (Jeremiah 9:23-24)  
> For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. (Hosea 6:6, ESV)    

When we arrive in the New Testament, the Word finds its focus:
> And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. (John 17:3)
> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. (Luke 24:27)  
> My goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. (Colossians 2:2-3)  
> In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son (Hebrews 1:1-2)  

We thus read the Bible to find Jesus. 
> But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. (Philippians 3:7-8, ESV)
> But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. (2 Peter 3:18)

And it is in this endeavour that we find the Holy Spirit to be active. Primarily, he inspired the writing of the New Teratament
> "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you." (John 15:26, ESV)
> “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. 1ut when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears ... He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.” (John 16:12-16)
> What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God ... But we have the mind of Christ. (2 Cor 2:12-16)

And conversely, we _only_ need the Bible:
> As for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, 15 and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:14-17)

### Knowing God

If the Bible is how we know about God, prayer is how we know God. But we need to deepen our prayer, and to do that we need to deepen how we read the Bible. Our goal must be to deepen our knowledge and love of God, and particulary Jesus, in which there are "boundless riches" to explore:
> Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ (Eph 3:8)

Thus, Charles Spurgeon could say:
> There is something exceedingly improving to the mind in a contemplation of the Divinity. It is a subject so vast, that all our thoughts are lost in its immensity; so deep, that our pride is drowned in its infinity …  
> Would you lose your sorrow? Would you drown your cares? Then go, plunge yourself in the Godhead’s deepest sea; be lost in his immensity; and you shall come forth as from a couch of rest, refreshed and invigorated. I know nothing which can so comfort the soul; so calm the swelling billows of sorrow and grief; so speak peace to the winds of trial, as a devout musing upon the subject of the Godhead. (Sermon at New Park St Chapel, Southward, 7 Jan 1855)

In this, there can be found intimacy with God. Jesus, praying to the Father, gave the remarkable promise that those who believe the gospel (the truth about Jesus) will be loved by the Father in the same way Jesus is loved by the Father:
>  “I have given them your word ... Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. ... I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. ... Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me." (John 17:13-23)

### Meditating on Scripture

To approach this, we must learn better to meditate on the Bible. Here we need to reclaim the Biblical sense of "meditation" from the modern sense (emptying one's mind). Meditating on God's word means seeking insight into God's words, works, and glory:
> Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked ... but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. (Psalms 1:1-2)
> On the glorious splendor of your majesty, and on your wondrous works, I will meditate. (Psalm 145:5 ESV)
> Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. (2 Timothy 2:7)
> Humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. (James 1:21)

**The goal of meditation is to lead**:
 - **To prayer, and faith**. "I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done. ... Answer me quickly, Lord ... Show me the way I should go, for to you I entrust my life." (Psalms 143:5-8)
 - **To the heart**. "But what does it say? 'The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,' that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved" (Romans 10:8-9)
 - **To obedience**. "Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it." (Joshua 1:8) "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says." (James 1:22)

## The Life of Faith

Sonship tells us how to read the Sermon on the Mount. Sonship is the basis of:
 - **Christian conduct**. Jesus gives the types of principles a father would give a son:
   - **Imitating the Father**: “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. … You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (Matt 5:44-48)
   - **Glorifying the Father**: “let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” (Matt 5:16) “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.” (Matt 6:9)
   - **Pleasing the Father**: “And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.” (Matt 6:4, 6, and 18)
 - **Christian prayer**. “Pray then like this: ‘Our Father in heaven.’’” (Matt 6:9). This means:
   - **Pray personally**: “when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.” (Matt 6:7-8)
   - **Pray boldly**: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. …. If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!” (Matt 7:7-11)
 - **The Life of Faith**. “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. … For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” (Matt 6:25-33)



## Practicalities

### Plan to read

The urgent is the enemy of the important, and there will always be things which feel more urgent that reading (or listening) to the Bible. 
So make a plan. Decide when you’ll read and where you’ll read. Find a way to remove distractions. 
Be realistic, and don’t worry if you miss a day or two. Or three. But keep persevering. 
It takes about [66 days](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-does-it-really-take-to-form-a-habit/) to really form a new habit, so keep at it!

## Follow a reading plan

Having a guide or a plan can be a wonderful support in getting us reading the Bible. At Trinity we are
currently using [this reading plan](https://mcusercontent.com/230f84425691a35de50182bb4/files/3540ebc0-492f-0315-a360-807cb425e855/Bible_Reading_Spring_2024_for_pdf.pdf),
which roughly lines up with the passages we're looking at on Sundays and in Fellowship Groups.
Robert Murray M’Cheyne's [reading plan](https://www.mcheyne.info/calendar.pdf) has been a blessing to devout Christians since the mid 1800's. 
Some may prefer a [Bible Reading plan for Shirkers & Slackers](https://ransomfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bible-Reading-Program-for-Shirkers-and-Slackers.pdf).
Some may want [match a plan with their reading intensity](http://voices.lifeway.com/discipleship-evangelism/find-a-bible-reading-plan-thats-right-for-you/). 
Or your Bible may have already come with a reading plan.
 
## Reading with someone else

If you can, reading with someone else has the benefit of keeping you (and them) accountable. And, you know,
of being sociable. You can just arrange to meet regularly, read through a passage of the bible (preferably
not the same one every time), and talk about what it means. For a bit more structure, [The Word one-to-one](https://www.theword121.com/)
is a great resource, providing guided reads through John's Gospel and the book of Acts, both in 
[book form](https://www.theword121.com/books-home) or as a free [app](https://www.theword121.com/app). 

## Structure your prayers

We all struggle at times with prayer, and have times where we may need to [relearn how to pray](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/start-asking-god-for-more).
At its simplest, prayer involves expressing gratitude, asking for forgiveness, and asking for God's blessing. 
It might be as creative as a prayer diary, maybe with an App (for example, check out [Prayer Mate](https://www.prayermate.net/app)).
It might pick up prayers written by others, like [Charles Spurgeon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/spurgeon-prayers/),
or even [those of Jesus](https://www.crossway.org/books/the-prayers-of-jesus-tpb/).

This is a prayer which we prayed when we were reading through [Ephesians](https://listen.trinitysc.nz/browse/series/80) together.

> God of our Lord Jesus Christ, glorious Father, may you give each of us at Trinity, the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that we may know you better. 
>
> We pray that the eyes of our hearts may be enlightened so that we may know the hope to which you have called us. May we know how much you treasure your holy people as the riches of your glorious inheritance. And may we grasp more of your incomparably great power for us who believe, that same power which you exerted when you raised Christ from the dead and seated him at your right hand. We praise you that Jesus is far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name. Give us joy as we remember that you placed all things under Jesus’ feet and appointed him to be head over everything for our sake as your church, Jesus’ body.
> 
> Lord, may these truths grip and thrill us so that Trinity might be full of thanks and joy, being eager to live for you all our days.
>
> In Jesus' name, Amen
