Many of us find it hard to keep persevering at reading the Bible and praying. Here's a bunch of things you can
try to improve your devotional life.

## Plan to read

The urgent is the enemy of the important, and there will always be things which feel more urgent that reading (or listening) to the Bible. 
So make a plan. Decide when you’ll read and where you’ll read. Find a way to remove distractions. 
Be realistic, and don’t worry if you miss a day or two. Or three. But keep persevering. 
It takes about [66 days](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-does-it-really-take-to-form-a-habit/) to really form a new habit, 
so keep at it!

## Follow a reading plan

Having a guide or a plan can be a wonderful support in getting us reading the Bible. Robert Murray M’Cheyne's
[reading plan](https://www.mcheyne.info/calendar.pdf) has been a blessing to devout Christians since the mid 1800's. 
Some may prefer a [Bible Reading plan for Shirkers & Slackers](https://ransomfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bible-Reading-Program-for-Shirkers-and-Slackers.pdf).
Some may want [match a plan with their reading intensity](http://voices.lifeway.com/discipleship-evangelism/find-a-bible-reading-plan-thats-right-for-you/). 
Or your Bible may have already come with a reading plan.

## Reading with someone else

If you can, reading with someone else has the benefit of keeping you (and them) accountable. And, you know,
of being sociable. You can just arrange to meet regularly, read through a passage of the bible (preferably
not the same one every time), and talk about what it means. For a bit more structure, [The Word one-to-one](https://www.theword121.com/)
is a great resource, providing guided reads through John's Gospel and the book of Acts, both in 
[book form](https://www.theword121.com/books-home) or as a free [app](https://www.theword121.com/app). 

## Structure your prayers

We all struggle at times with prayer, and have times where we may need to [relearn how to pray](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/start-asking-god-for-more).
At its simplest, prayer involves expressing gratitude, asking for forgiveness, and asking for God's blessing. 
It might be as creative as a prayer diary, maybe with an App (for example, check out [Prayer Mate](https://www.prayermate.net/app)).
It might pick up prayers written by others, like [Charles Spurgeon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/spurgeon-prayers/),
or even [those of Jesus](https://www.crossway.org/books/the-prayers-of-jesus-tpb/).
