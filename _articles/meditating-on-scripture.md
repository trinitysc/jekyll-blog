So _how_ do we humbly meditate on Scripture, in a way which lets it implant itself in us? 
<!--excerpt end-->
(This is part of a series on [Devotion](/articles/devotion/))

First, we can (and should) pray for the Spirit to enlighten us. This is a prayer which we prayed at Trinity when we were [reading through Ephesians](https://listen.trinitysc.nz/browse/series/80) together.

> God of our Lord Jesus Christ, glorious Father, may you give each of us at Trinity, the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that we may know you better. 
>
> We pray that the eyes of our hearts may be enlightened so that we may know the hope to which you have called us. May we know how much you treasure your holy people as the riches of your glorious inheritance. And may we grasp more of your incomparably great power for us who believe, that same power which you exerted when you raised Christ from the dead and seated him at your right hand. We praise you that Jesus is far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name. Give us joy as we remember that you placed all things under Jesus’ feet and appointed him to be head over everything for our sake as your church, Jesus’ body.
> 
> Lord, may these truths grip and thrill us so that we might be full of thanks and joy, being eager to live for you all our days. In Jesus' name, Amen

Having prayed for the Spirit's work, we then take our our time in the passage. Our aim is to move beyond understanding the passage to being
moved by it. Practically, we want to be able to pray meaningfully _from_ the passage; to respond to what God has said to us. 
At its simplest, prayer involves expressing adoration and [gratitude](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/start-asking-god-for-more), 
asking for forgiveness, and asking for God's blessing. Our reading therefore involves looking for things that make us love Jesus more; 
that convict us of our sin; or make us seek something new in God. So:

<div class="alert-info rounded p-3 m-3">
<p><b>Understand</b>. What does the passage say?</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the main point the author is making? How do the words he uses support this point?</li>
<li>How does this passage flow from the one before?</li>
<li>How does this passage fit into the book?</li>
</ul>
<p>Check your understanding. Go back to the passage with your conclusions and check that the passage reads the way you thought it did. For example, do your conclusions rely on anything the writer hasn't actually said in this passage?</p>
<p><b>Reflect</b>. What does this passage tell us about God? What does this passage tell us about man?</p>
<ul>
<li>What does this tell me about the person of Jesus; of the purposes and promises of God? </li>
<li>What does this tell me of salvation? </li>
<li>What does this tell me about loving and serving God, and my neighbour? </li>
<li>What encouragements or warnings does this give me?  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Personalise</b>. How does this passage inform my relationship with God?</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this passage help me love Jesus more?</li>
<li>What does this passage show me about the character of God that can I praise him for?</li>
<li>What does this passage show me about myself, as I am now, for which I can ask forgiveness from God?</li>
<li>What does this passage show me is missing in myself, as I am now, for which I petition God?</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Resources

Practically speaking, it can help to have a Reading Plan. Robert Murray M’Cheyne's [reading plan](https://www.mcheyne.info/calendar.pdf) has been a blessing to devout Christians since the mid 1800's. Or there is a [Bible Reading plan for Shirkers & Slackers](https://ransomfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Bible-Reading-Program-for-Shirkers-and-Slackers.pdf). Or your Bible may have already come with a reading plan. For a bit more structure when reading with someone else, [The Word one-to-one](https://www.theword121.com/) provides guided reads through John's Gospel and the book of Acts.

For help seeing the Big Picture, check out _[God's Big Picture](https://www.godsbigpicture.co.uk/)_ by Vaughan Roberts, or Graeme Goldsworthy's _[According to Plan](https://www.ivpress.com/according-to-plan)_. For a lighter walk through the Bible, being released weekly through 2025, check out our [40 Idioms](https://40-idioms.com) website.

When it comes to prayer, some find it helpful to look at prayers written by others, like [Charles Spurgeon](https://www.spurgeongems.org/spurgeon-prayers/),
or even [those of Jesus](https://www.crossway.org/books/the-prayers-of-jesus-tpb/).
