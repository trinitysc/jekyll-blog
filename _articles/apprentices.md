In 2025, we started our Ministry Apprenticeship Scheme. Our first apprentices are Grace Phillips, Mackenzie Shewan, and Pam Walters. 
<!--excerpt end-->

Here are two of the reasons why it is exciting to hear about people starting ministry apprenticeships:
- It's good for the lost.  In Matthew 9:37-38 Jesus famously says to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.  Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field." Having more people trained to share the word of Jesus, we pray, will lead to more people hearing about Jesus and being saved by the grace of God, not just here and now but in the future and elsewhere. 
- It's good for the church.  Read 1 Corinthians 12 and Ephesians 4 and you will read about the body of Christ.  Who is it who serves or works in the body of Christ?  We all do!  "From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work." (Eph. 4:16)  These apprenticeships give a great opportunity to encourage them in service and for them to encourage us in service.

The apprenticeship follows the structure created by [Multiply NZ](https://multiply.co.nz/apprenticeships/) and used at Latimer and Cornerstone. Apprentices work for 27 hours per week, with 13 allocated to study. 

Each apprenticeship lasts 2 years. We hope to add new apprentices each year. If you feel that you can pledge to support any of our current or future apprentices please email David Wong at <treasurer@trinitysc.nz> with: (a) a pledge amount; (b) timing of the pledge (when and how regularly); and (c) whether the pledge is specific to one apprentice or available to any of them.  Donations can be paid into the normal church bank account, tagged with either "MA" or the name of the supported apprentice. 

Please pray for Grace, Mackenzie, and Pam as they begin their new rols. And pray that God would be at work among us all at Trinity for the growth of his kingdom.
