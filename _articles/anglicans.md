At Trinity we, along with around 110 million people worldwide, are Anglicans. For many of us, and for many of those 110 million, it is not particularly important to us that we are Anglican. Most of us sought a welcomming church that faithfully taught the Bible, and where we could feel part of a church famiily. The beauty of Anglicanism is that it is a broad tent church. Nevertheless, we are Anglicans, and here's what that means to us.

<!--excerpt end-->

## Belief

It means we are Christians. We believe Jesus was the Son of God, was fully God in a way that no other person has ever been, and that he died that we might, through believing in him, have eternal life.

It means we believe the Bible is God's word, his revelation of who he is and of how we can be in a relationship wih him.

It means we value the voices of the 80-odd generations of Christians who have come before us, and the lessons we can learn from them. We believe church structures are good, because they can hold our leaders to account, and model to us that we serve others, and ultimately God, rather than ourselves.

It means we follow the 16th century reformers, and centuries of believers before them, in believing that it is the Bible that judges our thoughts and traditions, not the other way round. 


## Theology 

We hold to the historic creeds of the church. Creeds are summaries of the faith, usually developed in response to a specific debate. 

The Nicene Creed was adopted by the church in 325, "the church" meaning a council of bishops convened by the Roman emperor Constantine. It was drawn up to clarify a debate triggered by the charismatic cleric, Arius of Alexandria. The debate concerned the nature of Christ; how he could be fully God and yet somehow distinct from the Father. This is not an easy question to answer, and reason generally fails us when we do. How can we reason into the nature of the infinite? Any reference to experience must be flawed, since we do not experience the infinite. All we really have to go on is revelation; what God tells us of himself. The Nicene Creed nicely summarises what the Bible has to tell us about God. The Apostle's Creed, developed a century or two later, nicely summarises the Nicene Creed:

> I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
> creator of heaven and earth.  
>   
> I believe in Jesus Christ,  
> Godâ€™s only Son, our Lord,  
> who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
> born of the Virgin Mary,  
> suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
> was crucified, died, and was buried;  
> he descended to the dead.  
> On the third day he rose from the dead;  
> he ascended into heaven,  
> and is seated at the right hand of the Father;  
> from there he will come to judge  
> the living and the dead.  
>   
> I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
> the holy catholic Church,  
> the communion of saints,  
> the forgiveness of sins,  
> the resurrection of the body,  
> and the life everlasting. Amen.

## Church Service

In the contect of a church service, we will regularly say the Apostle's or the Nicene Creed. We also inherit the sacrements of baptism and communion (the Lord's Supper). We celebrate communion once a month at the 10:45 service, twice a month at the 9am service.

Beyond that, we are low church Anglicans in the sense that we place more importance on preaching and worship than on ritual.

## Wider Family

Being Anglicans also means we are part of something bigger than ourselves. We value being part of a wider family, being able to [support others](/about/missions)), and having others hold us to account.

Formally, we are part of the Diocese of the [Church of Confessing Anglicans, Aotearoa NZ](https://confessinganglicans.nz/). Our bishop is [Jay Behan](https://confessinganglicans.nz/leadership/), a gifted preacher, a winsome communicator. As a golfer he's apparently in need of extra grace. The Diocese is governed by a Standing Committee, of which our Kyla Horne is a member. Our Canons, our rules of operation, can be found [here](https://confessinganglicans.nz/documents/canons/).

For external accountability we also work with the [Multiply Group of Churches](https://multiply.co.nz/) and [Reach Australia](https://reachaustralia.com.au/).

A number of events, including annual Men's and Women's Conventions, as well as Risen events for youth, help us to connect with members of our sister churches.
