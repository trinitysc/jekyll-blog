<p>We are passionate about making sure everyone can hear the Word of God. At Trinity, we normally work through books of the Bible (called expository preaching) to think about what God is saying and how it applies to us today.</P

<p>We aim to upload our sermons on the Sunday they are preached to our <a href="https://listen.trinitysc.nz">Sermon Library</a> and Spotify.</p>
