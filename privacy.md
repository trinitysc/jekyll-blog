## 1. Introduction

Thanks for taking an interest in how we handle your information here at Trinity South Christchurch. We recognise the importance of protecting your privacy and want to assure you that we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is protected from misuse or unauthorised disclosure.

The key principles behind our privacy policy are:

1. To ensure that you understand that your information is collected with your permission, and what we do—and do not do—with it.
2. Explain the way we use your information in order to pastorally love and care for you as you seek to be a follower of Jesus.

## 2. Collection

Our primary means of collecting your information is through our connect cards. By completing a connect card you have voluntarily provided us with your personal information and consented to us collecting that information from you, and storing and using it in accordance with this policy and the Privacy Act 1993. We may also collect personal information from you when you contact one of our Ministers or when you request to be part of the church database or directory.

## 3. Purpose

Trinity South Christchurch uses personal information primarily for the purpose of pastorally caring for you. We also require it to keep you informed about upcoming events or activities related to our church family as well as developing our services. Your personal information is kept securely on our Church Management System called Jethro and we use Mailchimp for emailing purposes (recipients have the ability to unsubscribe at any time.)

## 4. Intended recipients

Access to your contact information is restricted to Trinity South Christchurch staff members and key ministry leaders. Prayer requests and comments submitted in Connect Cards will be held within the staff team and destroyed and disposed of securely. We will not use or disclose any information about you outside of the organisation for any other purpose, without first obtaining your consent, other than where the use or disclosure is permitted or required by law.

## 5. Access

You may request access, changes and updates to your personal information held by Trinity South Christchurch at any time. Should you have any complaints regarding Trinity South Christchurch’s treatment of your personal information, then please contact us with details and we will be happy to assist.
