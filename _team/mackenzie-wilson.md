Mackenzie loves opening the Bible with people, and seeing how God changes lives through his Spirit, and is excited to see more of that through her apprenticeship. In her down time she enjoys cross-stitching, walking Halswell Quarry, cooking for people and telling her (very patient) husband, Izaac, about exciting maths concepts.
