Kyla loves to see children come to know God and grow in their knowledge and love of Him each week as they discover more about Him at Sunday School each week. When she isnâ€™t teaching Sunday School Kyla works as a neuroscientist and loves spending time in her garden or cooking with her husband, Paul.
