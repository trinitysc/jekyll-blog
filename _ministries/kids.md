Sunday School classes are run during our service. We have a range of classes for kids from age 0 up to school year 8. All the children start with you in the service, before heading out to their classes about 10-15 minutes in (following an engaging childrenâ€™s talk or song).

Our excellent Sunday School teachers will look after them for the rest of the service, teaching them a great programme of Bible studies with activities and games.

Once the service has finished, your children will return to you, most likely with some of their own handiwork in their hands, reminding them of the great lesson they will have learned.

As a part of the Church of Confessing Anglicans Aotearoa New Zealand, we adhere to the Safe Ministry Blueprint to ensure the highest standards of ministry amongst vulnerable people.
