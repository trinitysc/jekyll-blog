At Trinity, our youth love spending time together - building friendships, having heaps of fun, and learning more about Jesus.

#### Years 7-10  
**Thursdays | 7:00-8:30pm**  
📍 *Trinity - 200 Colombo Street, Sydenham*

Our intermediate youth group is full of energy, games, laughter, and Bible teaching that helps young people grow in their faith and friendships.

#### Years 11-13  
**Sundays | 4:00-5:30pm**  
📍 *Trinity - 200 Colombo Street, Sydenham*

Senior youth is a relaxed and welcoming space to connect, ask big questions, encourage one another, and explore what it means to follow Jesus in everyday life.

Everyone is welcome! Come along to hang out, play games, and learn from the Bible as we grow together - loving God, loving one another, and loving the world around us.
