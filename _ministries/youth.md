Youth at Trinity love spending time together to learn about Jesus and have great fun.

We have a great youth group for those in school years 7-13. They meet on Tuesday evenings, 7:15-9:00pm at 200 Colombo St in Sydenham.

Any are welcome to come along and enjoy a great time hanging out, playing games and learning from the Bible to love God, to love each other, and to love the world around us.
