Young Adults is a thriving fellowship group for younger folk seeking a deeper understanding of the Bible. Through Young Adults, the church seeks to raise up a new generation of bible believing Christians. We meet once a week on Thursdays at church on 200 Colombo Street. Hot drinks will be available from 7:15pm, with the Bible study beginning at 7:30pm.

Additionally, we host an annual event of ‘YAWA’ (Young Adults’ Weekend Away), which usually consists of travelling to nearby locations like Hamner Springs and Castle Hill. This retreat includes guest speakers, various fun activities, and unforgettable memories!
