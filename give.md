Jesus paid a massive price on the cross so that the gospel could be freely offered to all. At Trinity we are passionate about making Jesus known without cost to hearers. We also don't want to give the impression that the church is after people's money so in our gatherings we don't pass a bag or take a collection, nor do our Ministers earn more if giving goes up!

We encourage all of our members - who know the free gift of Jesus - to be sacrificially giving to the work of the gospel at Trinity.
